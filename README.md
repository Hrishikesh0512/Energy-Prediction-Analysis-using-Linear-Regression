# Energy-Prediction-Analysis-using-Linear-Regression
# Description of the Project
The "Energy20.txt" dataset is used to develop models of energy consumption of appliances in an energy-efficient home. With 671 samples, the dataset provides the Energy use of appliances (denoted as Y). It's a reworked version of the data utilised in the research. The dataset contains five variables: X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and Y, which are stated as follows:
* X1: Temperature in kitchen area (Celcius)
* X2:Humidity in kitchen area (Percentage)
* X3:Temperature outside (from weather station in Celcius)
* X4:Humidity outside (from weather station in Percentage)
* X5:Visibility (from weather station in Kilometers)
* Y:Energy use of appliances,( in Whatts)

#Understanding the data

The general link between each of the variables X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and the variable of interest Y was reported using scatter plots and histograms. For each variable, include 5 scatter plots, 6 histograms, and 1 or 2 words, containing the variable of interest, Y.
